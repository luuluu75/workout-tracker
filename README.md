   ## Description 
    
   As a user, 
   I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. 
   I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. 
   I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. 
   If the exercise is a cardio exercise, 
   I should be able to track my distance traveled.
